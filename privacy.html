        <h1>Privacy Policy for Emoji Tapper</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 9, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Emoji Tapper. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our application.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We designed Emoji Tapper to be enjoyed without collecting any of your personal information. You can play the game without providing any data to us.</p>
        <p>The only exception is if you choose to submit your score to our public leaderboards. In that case, we collect the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Player Name:</strong> The name you voluntarily provide to be displayed next to your score.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Score:</strong> The score you achieved in the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The player name and score you submit are used for the sole purpose of displaying your ranking on the in-app leaderboards, which are visible to all players of the game.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use Firebase, a service provided by Google, to power our leaderboards. The data you submit (player name and score) is stored on this service. You can view Google's Privacy Policy for more information on how they handle data.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your leaderboard submissions are considered a permanent part of the historical game record and are not automatically deleted.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

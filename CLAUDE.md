# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "emoji-tapper" repository, which appears to be a new project that has not yet been implemented. The repository currently contains only a LICENSE file (MIT License) and git initialization files.

## Current State

The repository is in its initial state with:
- MIT License (Copyright 2025 Josh Estelle)
- Git repository initialized
- No source code, build system, or dependencies yet

## Development Setup

Since no code has been implemented yet, development commands and architecture will need to be established when the project structure is created.

## Next Steps

When implementing the emoji-tapper project, consider adding:
- Project structure and source code
- Package manager configuration (package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Build and development scripts
- Testing framework setup
- Documentation about the project's purpose and functionality

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated once the project structure and tooling are established.
